# js-weather-app

js-weather-app is a simple, responsive weather web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a minimal, user-friendly interface to search for a city and view the latest weather information (temperature, conditions, and related details). The project is ideal as a learning example for working with web APIs, DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design.
